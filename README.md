# Statistical Analysis Application

## Overview
This is a simple C program that performs statistical analysis on an array of unsigned characters. It provides functions to calculate various statistical measures such as median, mean, maximum, and minimum values of the array. Additionally, it includes a function to sort the array in ascending order and another function to print the elements of the array.

## Features
- Calculate median, mean, maximum, and minimum values of an array
- Sort an array in ascending order
- Print the elements of an array

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the `stats.c` file using a C compiler. You can use the following command:
`gcc stats.c -o stats.out`

3. Run the compiled executable. On Unix-like systems, you can use the following command:
`./stats.out`

4. Input your dataset in the `test` array within the `main()` function of `stats.c`.
5. Call the statistical functions as needed to analyze the dataset.

## Usage
- Modify the `test` array in `stats.c` to contain your dataset.
- Call the desired statistical functions from `main()` to analyze the dataset.
- Compile and run the program to see the statistical results.
